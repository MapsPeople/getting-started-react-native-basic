# Getting started projects

From the root of the project, open up a terminal and run `npm install`

```bash
npm install
```

Navigate inside the iOS folder in the terminal and run `pod install``

```bash
pod install
```

You should now be able to run the project by starting metro, and running either an android or iOS version.

```bash
npm start #Starts metro
#Specific to running on android
npm run android
```

To start the application on iOS. Open the folder and open the .xcworkspace and run the application from xcode.
